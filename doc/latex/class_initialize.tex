the user can change the parameters or use the default values by using flags when lauching the simulation The flags are\+: -\/r 1 to launch the simulation -\/g $<$double$>$ to set the inhibitory amplitude -\/f $<$double$>$ to set the Vext/\+Vthr ratio (ratio between external frequency and threshold frequency) -\/j $<$double$>$ to set the amplitude of excitatory spikes -\/h for more details about flags and their usage
